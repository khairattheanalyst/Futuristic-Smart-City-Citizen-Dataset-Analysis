**INTRODUCTION**

The aim of this project is to understand how people live, move, and interact in a smart city by analyzing their daily habits. The goal is to help city planners and government agencies make better decisions that improve sustainability, efficiency, and quality of life for everyone.

**Dataset Used:** The dataset used for this analysis is the Futuristic Smart City Citizen Activity Dataset, designed to capture how citizens interact with their urban environment. It includes detailed information on citizen's behavior related to mobility, energy consumption, health, digital engagement, and lifestyle habits.

**Data Limitations or Biases:** The dataset has some limitations that may impact the analysis. It consists of simulated data, which may not accurately reflect real-world behaviors or regional differences in a city environment. Additionally, certain key variables, such as income levels or specific local policies, are not included, which could affect factors like energy consumption or transportation choices.

**STEPS TAKEN TO CLEAN THE DATA**
1. I observed the dataset and removed duplicate entries to ensure the data contained only unique values and accurate information.
2. I reviewed the column headers to ensure consistency in naming and formatting, making sure there were no discrepancies. 
3. I checked for any null or blank values and handled them appropriately, either by removing or adjusting the data entries where necessary. I also deleted empty rows within the dataset to keep the data clean and focused only on valid entries.
4. I adjusted the column widths to ensure all data was visible and readable without any truncation.
5. I organized the data into a structured Excel table, which made it easier to sort, filter, and reference the information.
6. I applied a consistent font and color scheme throughout the dataset to enhance its readability and to also ensure a professional appearance.
 
**STAKEHOLDERS OF THE PROJECT**

Smart City Planners and Government Agencies. 

**INDUSTRY TYPE OF DATA**

The dataset falls under the Urban Development and Smart City Technology industry, focusing on the interaction between citizens and their environment within a smart city.

**PROBLEMS BEING ADDRESSED**
These are the potential questions derived from the pre-analysis phase to guide and identify areas for deeper exploration.

1. What is the relationship between age groups and total steps walked?
2. Do Females or Males consume the most home energy? 
3. What is the average number of calories burned by different age groups?
4. How much time do citizens spend on social media, and how does it vary across gender?
5. Which mode of transport is associated with the highest calories burned?
6. How do citizens allocate their time (work, entertainment, sleep) across demographics?
7. Which lifestyle activities (public event hours, shopping hours, entertainment hours) dominate citizens' daily routine?
8. How does mode of transport affect a citizen's carbon footprint? 

**NOTABLE TRENDS AND PATTERNS FROM THE DASHBOARD ANALYSIS**

**Key Performance Metrics**

The female gender has the highest home energy consumption with a total energy of 2900.85kWh consumed. 
The gender labeled others has the least home energy consumption with a total of 226.24kWh energy consumed. 
The age group that burned the most average calories are the ages between 68-77 burning an average calorie of 862.35.
The age group 18-27 burned the least average calories with a total average calorie of 799.56 burned. 
Among the different modes of transportation, Cars have the highest average carbon footprint of 55.88kgCO2.
Bikes have the least average carbon footprint of 53.02kgCO2 among the various modes of transportation. 
The gender labeled others spend the most average hours daily on social media, spending an average of 3.46 hours daily. 
The female gender spends the least average hours daily on social media, spending an average of 2.94 hours daily on social media. 
The age group 28-37 walked the most steps with an average of 10,853 steps. 
The age group 18-27 walked the least steps with an average of 10,210 steps. 
Citizens that walk as their mode of transport burns the most calories with a total of 162,922 calories burned.
Citizens that ride bicycles as their mode of transport burns the least calories with a total of 125,793 calories burned. 
Across the various genders, the average sleep hours have the most time allocation, followed by the average work hours. The average entertainment hours have the least time allocation across the various genders.

 

**DATA-DRIVEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A SUSTAINABLE, EFFICIENT AND LIVABLE CITY.** 

1. Promote low carbon transportation by prioritizing more infrastructures for bicycles and EVs i.e. more charging stations, safer bike lanes etc. 
2. Launch public campaigns encouraging reduced car usage so as to lower carbon footprints. 
3. Offer community points and tax rebates to citizens for choosing bikes, bicycle and EVs as their mode of transportation. i.e. If a citizen buys a bike for commuting, they might get a â‚¦15,000 rebate, meaning they pay less in taxes or get that amount refunded. 
4. Create fitness challenges and wellness campaigns targeted at the age group 18-27, with the lowest average calories burned and steps walked.
5. Promote and encourage tech-based wellness solutions (i.e.step counter apps with rewards, fitness apps) targeting the age group 18-27. 
6. Since the female gender uses the most energy at home, City planners can create simple energy-saving guides just for them. Also, they can give discounts on energy-saving appliances like fridges or bulbs, Share easy-to-use tools that help track and reduce energy usage (like smart meters) through Tv ads and also offer free tips on how to save power every day. 
7. The city planners and government agencies should implement infrastructures that make cities more walkable with green corridors, shade covers, resting areas, and walk-to-work campaigns.
8. Support active aging with light fitness infrastructures and wellness programs for the age range 68-77, who already show strong physical activity. These citizens should also be used as ambassadors in community health programs to influence younger age groups.
9. Government agencies can implement flexible work hours or hybrid models, especially where the gender labeled others works more but also sleeps and entertains slightly more. Offer wellness leave days, community gathering spots, and cultural activities to enhance quality of life for all genders.
 

**CONCLUSION**

This project provides a detailed analysis of how citizens in a futuristic smart city live, move, and engage with their environment. By looking into patterns in mobility, lifestyle, health, and energy consumption, the insights highlight key areas for smart city planners and government agencies to improve urban living.
While the dataset is simulated and may not reflect real-world complexity, it still offers valuable direction for developing people-centered, data-driven city policies. Recommendations such as promoting low-carbon transport, launching wellness campaigns, incentivizing sustainable behaviors, and tailoring policies by demographic patterns (e.g., age and gender) support the broader goal of creating a sustainable, efficient, and livable smart city. With the right strategies, this data-driven approach can help shape cities that truly enhance the quality of life for all citizens.
